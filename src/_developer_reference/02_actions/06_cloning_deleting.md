title: Cloning and deleting actions

## Deleting

While editing any action, you can delete it to remove it from the skill. The action will not be deleted until you save the skill. Click **Delete action...** while an action is selected to delete it.

## Cloning

You can also clone an action to make an identical copy of it in the same skill. Click **Clone action...** while an action is selected to clone it.

Cloning can be useful for testing changes to an action without disrupting use of the current version. Note however, that the cloned copy will initially have the same triggers, so any message that triggers the original will also trigger the copy.
