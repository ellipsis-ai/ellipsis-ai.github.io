The reference explains the core concepts and features of Ellipsis.

Ellipsis learns how to respond using **skills**, which can be installed or created from scratch. A skill is a collection of one or more **actions** that perform a task and/or return a response. Typically, all of the actions in a skill are related in some way, by theme or by the kind of data they use.
