## [Reference]({% link _developer_reference/00_index.md %})

The reference explains the core concepts and features of Ellipsis, a tool to perform tasks, work with data, and answer questions in chat.

Ellipsis learns how to respond using **skills** which can be installed or created from scratch. A skill is a collection of one or more **actions** that perform a task and/or return a response. Typically, all of the actions in a skill are related in some way, by theme or by the kind of data they use.
